# WARNING: DEPRECATED / NOT USED

# This folder previously contained a Zigbee2MQTT instance configured to use the same
# coordinator as `zigbee2mqtt2` (G02), which caused conflicts (duplicate base_topic +
# duplicate serial port).
#
# Keep this file as a safe placeholder only (no coordinator connection).
